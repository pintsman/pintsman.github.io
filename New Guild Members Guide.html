<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=4 data-line-end=5><a target='_blank' id="Overview_4"></a>Overview</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">This guide is split into 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<a href="#Part_1__Information_for_new_players_23"><li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Part 1 - Information for new players</li></a>
<a href='#Part_2__Information__links_for_all_guild_members_298'><li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Part 2 - Information for all guild members</li></a>
<a href='#Part_3__Resources__links_368'><li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="12">Part 3 - Resources &amp; links</li></a>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">If you’re a brand new World of Warcraft player then you should probably start with part 1. Experienced players will probably want to skip to part 2 as the information in the first part will likely not be that relevant for them. Part 1.3 (what to do at level 120) may be of some interest to all players as it contains links to information about important end game attunements and gear unlocks.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Everybody should read Part 2 as it contains important information about the guild, it’s activities and events and how to get the most out of being a member of Surprisingly Incompetent.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">Part 3 contains a summary of some useful links to other websites.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">The initial focus of this guide will largely be on Player vs Environment (PvE) activities as I’m not very knowledgeable around Player vs Player (PvP), but I will attempt to add more details for the PvP community over time.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">This guide isn’t intended to be exhaustive - there’s already plenty of guides and information available on different fan websites such as <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/">wowhead</a>, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.icy-veins.com/">icy veins</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Wowpedia">wowpedia</a> which go into far greater detail that I didn’t want to replicate here. The intention with this guide is to be a brief summary of important points and directions to help guild members find the information they need more easily, without wading through pages and pages of uninteresting trivia.</p>

<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=23 data-line-end=24><a target='_blank' id="Part_1__Information_for_new_players_23"></a>Part 1 - Information for new players</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">If this is the first time you’ve played world of warcraft, or are returning after a very long time away start here!</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=27 data-line-end=28><a target='_blank' id="11_Getting_from_level_1_to_level_110_27"></a>1.1 Getting from level 1 to level 110</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">Your primary goal with a brand new character is to increase it’s experience level until you reach the end-game “cap” (currently level 120). Getting from level 110 to 120 is covered in more detail in section 1.2, this section will aim to give an overview of the various ways you can gain experience and as a result increase your character’s experience level to 110 first.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32">In some cases you may have access to a character boost as part of your game purchase. If you choose to use this and boost your character straight to level 110 or 120 (dependant on the edition of WoW you purchased), you may still find it helpful to read some or all of this section as it contains information that will help you to better understand how playing WoW works.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=33 data-line-end=34><a target='_blank' id="Questing_and_the_World_33"></a>Questing and the World</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">As we will see, there are several different ways that your character can gain experience points and as a result, levels. One of the most commonly used ways to do this is via “questing”, or the completion of quests.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">Questing in WoW has changed somewhat over the years and expansions that have preceeded it, but the general pattern to questing can be summarised below:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="41">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">Quests are typically handed out by Non-player Characters (NPCs) in towns or areas near to where the quest objectives are. Look for the NPCs with the yellow exclamation mark above their head in the zone where you want to quest and speak to them to obtain the quests.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="55">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">The world in Warcraft is divided into regions or “zones”, and each zone will have quests relevant to a particular level range. There are a large number of zones in Azeroth now so I wont detail each individual one, but the overall land-masses relevant to each level range are:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">a) Level 1 to 60 Quests - Kalimdor &amp; Eastern Kingdoms</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46">b) Level 60 to 80 Quests - Outland &amp; Northrend</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">c) Level 80 to 90 Quests - Vash’jir, Hyjal, Deepholm, Uldum, Twilight Highlands, Pandaria</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">d) Level 90 to 100 Quests - Dreanor</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="51" data-line-end="52">e) Level 100 to 110 Quests - Broken Isles</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">The quests in each zone “scale”, which means that as long as you are at or below the level cap for that zone (and in some cases above the minimum level - check the in game map which will tell you the actual min level for the zone youre in) then you can stay in that zone and get full experience benefit from completing the quests. This scaling also means that the enemies you face (mobs) will also scale in terms of health and the damage they do to maintain the same level of difficulty up to the level cap for that zone.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="57">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">Complete the quest objectives</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="59">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="58">Return to the NPC that gave you the quest, or in some cases you may need to go to a different NPC (additionally some quests can be completed without visiting any NPCs at all) and speak to them again to hand the quest in to receive your experience and possibly also an additional reward.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="61">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">Many NPCs can give “chains” of quests - as you complete one quest and hand it in the NPC may give you another quest to do. If this doesn’t happen then simply look for another NPC with the quest exclamation mark or if there are none left you will need to move to another area with a suitable level range.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="62">If you cant find objectives or are stuck on a quest <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/">wowhead</a> is usually your best friend for up to date information and advice from other WoW players about anything relating to questing.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=63 data-line-end=64><a target='_blank' id="Dungeons_63"></a>Dungeons</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="65" data-line-end="66">Upon reaching level 10 you can also adventure into dungeons as an additional or alternative way to obtain experience points and gear rewards. Dungeons are instanced (so seperate to the main world) experiences for 5 players that typically involve killing a number of bosses, and associated “trash” mobs, in order to complete. Experience is awarded from each kill within the dungeon, boss kills can also drop useful gear to increase your characters power. Additionally many dungeons have associated quests that will reward additional experience and rewards upon completion, the quest givers are usually found inside or nearby the dungeon entrance.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">Dungeons have a related experience level that they are tuned for, so generally you need to ensure you are of at least the minimum required level for a specific dungeon or you will find that the creatures found within will be extremely difficult to kill. If you’re not sure if a dungeon is of an appropriate level range for your character opening the in-game adventure guide (next to the shop and help menu buttons on your mini action bar) will normally help you determine this.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70">Information about each of the boss creatures within the various dungeons and in particular their abilities and things to watch out for can also be found in the in-game adventure guide.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72">A dungeon group is normally made up of the following composition:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74">1 Tank (<a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/tanking-guide">https://www.wowhead.com/tanking-guide</a>)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="74" data-line-end="75">1 Healer (<a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/healing-guide">https://www.wowhead.com/healing-guide</a>)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="77">3 Damage Dealers (also referred to as “DPS”) (<a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/ranged-dps-spec-overview-and-tips">https://www.wowhead.com/ranged-dps-spec-overview-and-tips</a>, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/melee-dps-guide">https://www.wowhead.com/melee-dps-guide</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="77" data-line-end="78">It is possible to create dungeon groups with a different composition, but this is almost always sub-optimal and not recommended.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="79" data-line-end="80">There are 2 ways to enter a dungeon</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="81" data-line-end="83">Create a group by inviting players yourself (or be invited to a group by someone else) and go to the dungeon entrance ( check the adventure guide for a map of where this is).</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="83" data-line-end="84">or</p>
<ol start="2">
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="85" data-line-end="87">Use the Dungeon Finder facility within the Group Finder tool (the eye button 2 buttons to the left of the adventure guide button).</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="87" data-line-end="88">Using the group finder tool has some benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="89" data-line-end="90">You dont have to know who you’re grouping with, or spend time looking for and convincing people to join your group</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="90" data-line-end="91">It teleports you straight into the instance when all slots in the group have been filled (so you dont have to travel there yourself)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="91" data-line-end="92">Depending on the the role(s) you select you may received some additional rewards for using it (this tends to be for the 2 less played roles of tank &amp; healer)</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=94 data-line-end=95><a target='_blank' id="Raids_94"></a>Raids</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="96" data-line-end="97">Raids work a lot like dungeons, but are scaled for much larger groups of players (the actual sizes varies depending on the expansion that the raid was introduced, read on for more details).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="98" data-line-end="99">Typically raids are aimed at max level players for each expansion of the game, so the first raids you would become eligible for will be at level 60 (Molten Core, Blackwing Lair &amp; Ahn’Qiraj). After that the raids follow the same maximum level requirement for each expansion; so level 70 for Burning Crusade raids, level 80 for Wrath of the Lich King raids, level 85 for Cataclysm raids, level 90 for Mists of Pandaria raids, level 100 for Warlords of Dreanor raids and level 110 for Legion raids.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="100" data-line-end="101">The composition of raids has changed much over the years and expansions and can be a little confusing. A simplified view is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="102" data-line-end="104">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="102" data-line-end="103">Before Mists of Pandaria (specifically before the Siege of Orgrimmar raid in MoP), raids are typically tuned for either 25 players or in some cases 10 players. You can enter with a different number of players but be aware that the mobs and bosses will always be tuned for the highest number for that size (so 10 or 25 players). Some of the raids have Normal and Heroic modes, where Heroic usually has additional mechanics, more boss health and higher damage output.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="104" data-line-end="111">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="104" data-line-end="105">With the Siege of Orgrimmar raid in MoP and every raid after there are now 4 standard difficulty levels</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="106" data-line-end="107">Raid Finder (this is the easiest difficulty, more on raid finder below)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="107" data-line-end="108">Normal</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="108" data-line-end="109">Heroic</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="109" data-line-end="111">Mythic (the hardest difficulty, usually with more challenging boss mechanics and much higher boss and trash health and damage)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="111" data-line-end="112">Raid Finder (also called LFR) difficulty is always a 25 man raid. Normal &amp; Heroic difficulties can be completed with any composition of players but must be at least 10 and no more than 25 players, these raids scale automatically so that boss and trash mob health and damage reflect the size of the raid (so difficulty should be roughly similar irrespective of how many players are in the raid). Mythic difficulty is always tuned for a 20 man raid.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="113" data-line-end="114">Raid Finder difficulty is associated directly with the Raid Finder tool which becomes available in the group finder once you reach level 85 (so become elegible for Cataclysm raids). The Raid Finder tool works exactly like it’s Dungeon Finder sibling in that it will automatically put you into a queue based on the role (Tank, Healer or Damage) that you select and match you to the first raid group available. Because Raid Finder groups are always 25 man raids you do not have any control over the composition; they are always 2 tanks, 5 Healers and 18 Damage Dealers.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="115" data-line-end="116">Normal, Heroic &amp; Mythic difficutly raid groups must be formed by inviting people directly and then travelling (or being summoned) to the raid instance entrance.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=117 data-line-end=118><a target='_blank' id="Warmode_117"></a>Warmode</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="119" data-line-end="120">Warmode is the new world PvP system. When you enable warmode (to the right in your talents window) you make yourself attackable by members of the alliance faction, however doing so can significanly increase experience rewards from completing quests and killing mobs so it can be a good way to level your character faster.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="121" data-line-end="122">Typically world PvP on the Turalyon &amp; Doomhammer servers is pretty rare so enabling Warmode doesn’t carry a great deal of risk. Just be aware of any alliance players that appear to be hanging around while you’re questing and be prepared to defend yourself if any do happen to decide to attack.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="123" data-line-end="124">As far as I know Warmode has no affect on dungeons or raids.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=125 data-line-end=126><a target='_blank' id="Battlegrounds__PvP_125"></a>Battlegrounds &amp; PvP</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="127" data-line-end="128">I’ll add more details to this section when I get more details from some proper PvP’ers, but my limited understanding of PvP in WoW is this:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="129" data-line-end="130">Below level 120 there is primarily two forms of “casual” PvP you can join by using the Player vs Player tab in the group finder tool.</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="131" data-line-end="133">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="131" data-line-end="132">Battlegrounds &amp; Epic Battlegrounds pit raid sized groups of horde players against similar sized groups of alliance players in capture the flag and king of the hill type PvP maps.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="133" data-line-end="135">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="133" data-line-end="134">Arena matches are much smaller and follow a more “group deathmatch” model for PvP gameplay with 2v2 and 3v3 formats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="135" data-line-end="136">PvP also rewards experience points and other items so can be an interesting method to level characters for players who like the challenge of combat against other players rather than computer controlled enemies, although it may be slower to level exclusively through PvP alone.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=137 data-line-end=138><a target='_blank' id="The_Adventure_Guide_137"></a>The Adventure Guide</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="139" data-line-end="140">You’ve probably noticed the in-game Adventure Guide mentioned a few times here - its the button on your mini bar with a book on it to the left of the Shop &amp; Game Menu buttons. You can also press Shift-J on your keyboard to open the guide too.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="141" data-line-end="142">Getting familiar with the Adeventure Guide will greatly improve your in-game experience. It contains a wealth of information about dungeons and raids including boss abilities and loot drops, and for higher level instances even overviews and tips of things to watch out for when fighting the bosses. All this information is available right there in-game at the touch of a button.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="143" data-line-end="144">Its also worth pointing out that you can often receive zone starting quests directly from the Adventure Guide as well, which can save you a trip back to the Heroes Calling Board.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=145 data-line-end=146><a target='_blank' id="Alts_145"></a>Alts</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="147" data-line-end="148">Maybe the relevancy of this in the 1 to 110 levelling section is questionable, but i feel its worth mentioning here in case you’ve decided to level up one or more other characters. Most players in WoW will have more than one character in their roster, but one is typically the character they focus on progressing with gear and through content. We call this character their “Main” character and all other characters in their roster are called “Alts”. You will see these terms used in lots of different guides and videos so its worth understanding what they mean.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="149" data-line-end="150">WoW has a number of helpful feature that help you level alt characters quicker, although many only become available when you get at least one of your characters to maximum level (120). These features include:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="151" data-line-end="153">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="151" data-line-end="152">Heirlooms - Gear that can be purchased from a number of sources that increase the experience gained by the character wearing them and also scale as the character levels so that you dont have to worry about replacing it. Heirlooms can be quite expensive though so only really recommended for players who have a max level character with plenty of gold!</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="153" data-line-end="155">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="153" data-line-end="154">Draught of Ten Lands - This can be purchased from <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=148924/provisioner-mukra">Provisioner Mukra</a> for 5 Honorbound Service Medals (obtainable from Warfronts at level 120 and doing faction assaults). You can mail these potions to your alts and they increase experience gains by 10% and stats by 10 for one hour.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="155" data-line-end="156">These items will be marked “Binds to Blizzard account” which allows you to purchase them on your main character and then mail them to your alts (or in the case of heirlooms you can just create an heirloom you own from the heirlooms tab of the collections tool on your minibar).</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=157 data-line-end=158><a target='_blank' id="12_Welcome_to_Zandalar__How_to_get_to_level_120_157"></a>1.2 Welcome to Zandalar! - How to get to level 120</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="159" data-line-end="160">Once you reach level 110 you’ll automatically be offered a quest chain which asks you to return to Orgrimmar and then requires you to undertake a couple of scenarios (Battle for Lordaeron &amp; The Stormwind Extraction). Completion of these scenarios introduces you to the new quest hub of Zandalar where you’ll be spending most of your time from now on, and the achievement “Welcome to Zandalar”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="161" data-line-end="162">If the quest does not pop automatically trying re-logging or changing zone. It’s also worth noting that the two scenarios can be skipped on alt characters, they are only required if this is your first character doing them.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=163 data-line-end=164><a target='_blank' id="Zandalar_Story_Zones_163"></a>Zandalar Story Zones</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="165" data-line-end="166">The “traditional” way to level from 110 to 120 involves more questing which will involve following the story line in each of the 3 Zandalar zones - Zuldazar, Voldun &amp; Nazmir. You’re free to do the zones in any order and indeed you can switch between as you see fit.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="167" data-line-end="168">There are alternative ways to obtain experience levels to questing (see below for more details), but be aware that if this is your first level 110-120 character a number of end game systems are only unlocked by activiting world quests when you reach level 120 and this requires reaching Friendly reputation status with the 3 story zone factions (Zandalari, Voldunai &amp; Talanji’s Expedition respectively). If you do the story quests you’ll easily reach this level reputation by the time you hit 120, but if you use an alternative means of levelling you may have to come back and do quests to reach Friendly status anyway.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="169" data-line-end="170">Alt characters do not need to meet the reputation requirements to unlock world quests, so this is not really an issue for any subsequent characters you level between 110 and 120 after the first one.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="171" data-line-end="172">I believe characters boosted straight to level 120 already start with sufficient reputation, but I’ve not tried it myself so that needs to be confirmed.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=173 data-line-end=174><a target='_blank' id="The_War_Campaign_173"></a>The War Campaign</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="175" data-line-end="176">Completion of the whole War Campaign is not strictly necessary to access the important end game systems, but it can be fun and getting to Exhalted reputation with The Honorbound makes some interesting upgrades to the 3 quest hubs in Zandalar available.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="177" data-line-end="178">In order to unlock world quests you will need to complete the first 3 “foothold” quests in the War Campaign though. To be honest its probably a good idea to do this anyway as otherwise getting to Kul’Tiras will only be possible via summons which can be pretty inconvenient later on.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=179 data-line-end=180><a target='_blank' id="BfA_Dungeons_179"></a>BfA Dungeons</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="181" data-line-end="182">Running dungeons is another way to get to level 120, from 110 to 120 only normal difficulty dungeons will be available in the group finder, but they reward significant amounts of experience and nice gear and can be fun to do in groups of friends. Be aware that reputation could be an issue if you’re levelling this way with your first character though (see the section above about the Zandalar Story Zones for more details). That being said Alt characters dont have the same restrictions around faction reputation so levelling in dungeons can definitely be very attractive for the additional characters in your roster.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=183 data-line-end=184><a target='_blank' id="Island_Expeditions_183"></a>Island Expeditions</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="185" data-line-end="186">Island expeditions also become available fairly early on after level 110 and give you a way to gain both reasonable amounts of azerite power (AP) as well as experience points.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="187" data-line-end="188">Until you reach level 120 you’ll only be able to do normal difficult expeditions, the queue for these is accessed at the island expeditions table down in the port area next too <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=123000/captain-rezokun">Captain Rez’okun</a>.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=189 data-line-end=190><a target='_blank' id="Faction_Assaults_189"></a>Faction Assaults</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="191" data-line-end="192">Faction assaults work like World Quests with an additional objective after 4 have been completed, but unlike WQs they can be done by any character from level 110 upwards. For characters under level 120 they reward a significant experience gain bonus upon completion that lasts for an hour so they can be another good way to speed up the levelling experience. Faction assaults run on a timed basis, you can find out when the next one is <a target='_blank' href="https://wow.gameinfo.io/bfa-invasions">here</a>. The locations of each assault are not predictable (althought they do predictably swap from Zandalar to Kul Tiras and back each time), but you can see where it is quite clearly by looking at the in-game map focussed on Zanadalar or Kul Tiras when an assault is up.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=193 data-line-end=194><a target='_blank' id="13_Congrats_you_made_it__end_game__things_to_do_at_level_120_193"></a>1.3 Congrats you made it! - end game &amp; things to do at level 120</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="195" data-line-end="196">So you just dinged level 120 and you think you’re done with progressing your character. Think again…</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=197 data-line-end=198><a target='_blank' id="Gear_Gear__More_Gear_197"></a>Gear, Gear &amp; More Gear</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="199" data-line-end="200">So once you hit level 120 the immediate thing you’ll notice is that your experience bar will disappear, so surely this means no more “leveling”. Well actually no, not at all. All that changes is the “what” you’re levelling now. At level 120 the focus really switches to your character’s gear, and the item level of your gear is the key measure of where your character is at in terms of being eligible for dungeons, raids etc…</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="201" data-line-end="202">So now that you know that getting better gear is the key to making your character stronger and eligible for higher tiers of end-game content lets get into how you can do this.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=203 data-line-end=204><a target='_blank' id="Finding_Upgrades_203"></a>Finding Upgrades</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="205" data-line-end="206">One of the challenges around obtaining new gear is knowing which pieces are actually an upgrade for your character or not. When your item level is quite low (so below 400 really) this isn’t too difficult as the gear will typically be an upgrade if it is of the correct type for your character class (cloth, leather, mail or plate) and has a higher ilvl than your currently equpped piece. The reason for this is because you typically want to increase your characters equipped ilvl reasonably quickly at first due to the fact that a number of activites in end game only become available at certain ilvl points. A good example of this is the Raid Finder, where the 4 available raids only become available to queue when you reach a certain equipped ilvl as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="207" data-line-end="208">Uldir - Requires a minimum equipped ilvl of 340</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="208" data-line-end="209">Battle of Dazar’alor - Requires 370</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="209" data-line-end="210">Crucible of Storms - Requires 380</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="210" data-line-end="211">Eternal Palace - Requires 380</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="211" data-line-end="213">Ny’alotha - Requires 410</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="213" data-line-end="214">As you get into the higher 4xx ilvls (especially from around 445 onwards) then you also want to start finding pieces that have the “right” stats on them for your class and specs. This is a fairly complicated subject because different classes and specialisations can have very different stat “priorities” (the order in wich you should prefer stats on your gear) and can get even more confusing with the introduction of gear corruptions as well. This guide is too small to do that discussion justice, but instead here are some links to good guides and websites that can help players with these decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="215" data-line-end="216"><a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/classes">wowhead class guides</a></li>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="217" data-line-end="219"><a target='_blank' href="https://www.askmrrobot.com/">ask mr robot</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="219" data-line-end="220">Ask mr robot is a personal favourite of mine as it has great tools to help you optimise your current gear (Gear Check) and identify best in slot items (BiS). You can import characters from the wow armory as long as you know the character and realm name, and it also has an add-on you can install that will let you import character gear data without needing you to log out to update the armory.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="221" data-line-end="222">One final word of warning - character gearing and in particular class stat priorities can be a very subjective discussion and it’s not uncommon for the various guides to disagree with each other to a greater or lesser extent. In these cases theres rarely a “right” or “wrong” answer, just probably more than one way to optimise that character’s gear.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=203 data-line-end=204><a target='_blank' id="TLDR_GEAR_UP_203"></a>TLDR; - How To Quickly Gear Up a New 120 Character</h4>
<p class="has-line-data">There's a very quick cheatsheat on Reddit for getting a fresh 120 character to a good ilvl of gear very quickly (thanks Spebbie for the link) <a target='_blank' href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/g06gmo/for_anyone_trying_to_gear_fresh_alts_in_83/">here</a>.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=223 data-line-end=224><a target='_blank' id="World_Quests_223"></a>World Quests</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="225" data-line-end="226">World quests become available at level 120 as long as you’ve unlocked them through the pre-requisite items -</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="227" data-line-end="228">Unlock the 3 footholds in Kul Tiras as part of the War Campaign</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="228" data-line-end="230">Complete <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/quest=51916/uniting-zandalar">Uniting Zandalar</a> (this is only required on your first character, once the quest has been completed by a character on your account subsequent alt characters just need to speak to Nathanos to complete the quest without needing to get the friendly reputations).</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="230" data-line-end="231">Additionally if you want to unlock world quests in Nazjatar you will also need to do some of the Nazjatar story quest chain (starts from Nathanos once the above 2 steps are done) to enable that.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="232" data-line-end="233">World Quests give gear rewards up to item level (ilvl) 420 depending on the current ilvl of your character’s gear (it will scale up as your character’s equipped ilevel increases, up to a maximum of 420).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="234" data-line-end="235">Additionally the Emissary hand-ins for the day may reward a piece of gear up to ilvl 445 (including azerite armor) depending again on the equipped ilvl of the character.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=236 data-line-end=237><a target='_blank' id="Dungeon_Difficulties_at_Level_120_236"></a>Dungeon Difficulties at Level 120</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="238" data-line-end="239">At level 120 Heroic &amp; Mythic dungeon difficulties will become available to your character which reward gear as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="240" data-line-end="241">Heroic - 415 ilvl</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="241" data-line-end="242">Mythic - 430 ilvl</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="242" data-line-end="244">Mythic+ - scales depending on key level, see the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/mythic-keystones-and-dungeons-guide#item-level-loot-tables">Mythic+ guide on wowhead</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="244" data-line-end="245">Generally speaking Heroic difficulty is well tuned to fresh 120 players, and Mythic difficulty is much the same but requires you to make the group yourself rather than queuing in the dungeon finder. Some bosses do have additional abilities on Mythic difficulty which can be viewed in the adventure guide but Mythic difficulty is typically on par with Heroic, so it’s worth running Mythic if you can make the groups for the better ilvl loot. That being said if forming the groups yourself is proving difficult heroic dungeons can be queued easily in the dungeon finder and the queues can be fairly quick depending on the day and time of day, especially if you are a healer or a tank.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="246" data-line-end="247">Mythic+ is a system where the dungeon content and boss abilities remain the same as Mythic difficulty, but the health &amp; damage of bosses and mobs scale with higher “keystone” ranks which increase the difficulty of the dungeons but reward higher ilvl gear. Additionally Mythic+ dungeons are timed, so to get the best rewards you are also racing against the clock to complete the dungeon. Also higher level Mythic+ keystones have affixes which introduce extra mechanics into the trash and boss fights that make higher level Mythic+ dungeons much harder.

<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=248 data-line-end=249><a target='_blank' id="BfA_Raids_248"></a>BfA Raids</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="250" data-line-end="251">The 4 raids available to level 120 players come with the standard 4 difficulty levels of Raid Finder, Normal, Heroic &amp; Mythic. The guild is currently actively progressing in Heroic Ny’alotha with the aim of building a 20 man team for the Mythic difficulty level in the near future. We also organise a couple of Normal difficulty Ny’alotha runs each week to help guild members gear up and learn the encounters, both the Heroic &amp; Normal difficulty events are created in the calendar and all times are in Realm Time (CET) so if you’re not sure when these raids are happening just check the in-game calendar for more info.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="252" data-line-end="253">We don’t actively run the older BfA raids (Uldir, Dazar’alor, Crucible &amp; Eternal Palace) as a guild, but if guild members are interested in doing these we can organise events as and when needed if there is sufficient demand.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=254 data-line-end=255><a target='_blank' id="Island_Expeditions_at_Level_120_254"></a>Island Expeditions at Level 120</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="256" data-line-end="257">At level 120 you’ll get access to a few new difficulty levels for island expeditions - heroic, mythic &amp; pvp. Heroic &amp; mythic expeditions (often just called expes) are slightly harder versions of the existing island experience but reward more AP and better loot. PvP actually pits you against an alliance team of players so is more akin to a battleground, although the objective is still to collect the required amount of azerite in order to win the expedition.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="258" data-line-end="259">Islands can be a faster way to collect AP. Note that often players want to do the mythic difficulty level because it rewards the most AP and best loot, but mythic groups have to be formed first and waiting for 3 players who want to do them can sometimes take time. If you’re struggling to get a mythic expedition group together I would recommend just queuing for heroic expeditions at the table instead as you’ll probably save yourself a lot of time.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=260 data-line-end=261><a target='_blank' id="The_Black_Empire_Campaign__How_to_Get_Your_Legendary_Cloak_260"></a>The Black Empire Campaign &amp; How to Get Your Legendary Cloak</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="262" data-line-end="263">The Black Empire Campaign was introduced in the most recent BfA patch (8.3) and incorporates some new game features such as horrific visions, assaults and also a new upgradeable legendary cloak. If you want to raid the last two bosses in Ny’alotha (Carapace &amp; N’zoth) then having the legendary cloak is mandatory as without it your character is instantly mind controlled when the bosses are engaged. Even if you’re not interested in the raids the cloak is still very desirable as at higher “ranks” (obtained through upgrades) the cloak’s ilvl increases and gains additional resisitance to the corruption mechanic plus some nice additional effects at certain ranks. Indeed obtaining and upgrading the cloak is the primary means that permits a character to equip higher levels of corrupted gear.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="264" data-line-end="265">Obtaining the cloak requires the completion of some pre-requisites and then a fairly long chain of quests (can be completed in a few hours typically), here’s a summary of what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="266" data-line-end="267">Unlock World Quests in Zandalar &amp; Kul Tiras (see the World Quests section above for more details)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="267" data-line-end="268">Unlock Nazjatar and progress the Nazjatar story quest chain until you reach the point where Magni asks you to return to the Chamber of Heart to upgrade your Heart of Azeroth to level 50.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="268" data-line-end="269">Complete the Heart of Azeroth level 50 upgrade quest.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="269" data-line-end="271">Valeera Sanguinar will now appear in the Great Seal in Dazar’Alor and offer a quest - this is the starting point for the legendary cloak and N’zoth story quest chain and completing the quests will introduce you to the new features and ultimately reward the cloak at rank 1.</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="271" data-line-end="272">Once you have the cloak it’s ranks can be upgraded by completing objectives in the horrific visions - the objectives required depend on the current rank of the cloak but typically lower ranks only require completing the easiest zone whereas as the cloak increases in power you will need to venture into the harder zones to further empower it.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="273" data-line-end="274">There’s a full description of the quest chain <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/visions-of-nzoth-introduction-questline-horrific-visions-assaults">here on wowhead</a>.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="275" data-line-end="276">If you’ve done all of the pre-requisites but Valeera hasn’t appeared try logging out and back in again. Changing zones can also fix this issue if it happen.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=277 data-line-end=278><a target='_blank' id="Heart_of_Azeroth_at_Level_120__Neck_Essences_277"></a>Heart of Azeroth at Level 120 &amp; Neck Essences</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="279" data-line-end="280">Another reason for unlocking the Heart of Azeroth level 50 upgrade is that it also grants access to the Neck Essence system introduced in patch 8.2. Neck essences are powerful items that can be slotted into your Heart of Azeroth and can also be upgraded in terms of ranks. The essences come from a variety of sources, some from completing quests or building reputation with various factions, some from achievements and mythic dungeons and some from pvp. The list is quite long but obtaining the correct essences for your character and specialisation is an important task for getting the most power out of your character and should be considered as equally important as upgrading your gear ilvl.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="281" data-line-end="282">More information about the Heart of Azeroth essences can be found <a target='_blank' href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/heart-of-azeroth-essence-overview">here on wowhead</a></p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=283 data-line-end=284><a target='_blank' id="Rated_PvP_283"></a>Rated PvP</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="285" data-line-end="286">Not so much related to character gear progression but its worth mentioning rated PvP, which also becomes available to players on reaching level 120, for guild members who would like to get involved in more serious PvP competition.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="287" data-line-end="288">My knowledge of the Rated PvP system is very limited but I will try to expand the information here when I can. Essentially rated PvP is a leaderboard based equivalent of the “casual” PvP experience to all characters described in section 1.1, where players are rated based on the outcome of each match and higher ratings reward titles and some better gear. Because this is the competition side of the PvP system in WoW you should expect it to be very competitive, especially at higher rating levels.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="289" data-line-end="290">The following PvP activities can be joined through the Rated PvP section in the group finder</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="291" data-line-end="292">2v2 Arena</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="292" data-line-end="293">3v3 Arena</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="293" data-line-end="295">10v10 Rated Battleground</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="295" data-line-end="296">There’s a good guide on <a target='_blank' href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/pvp-starter-guide-for-gear-and-talents">icy veins here</a> that goes into more detail for players starting out in WoW PvP at max level.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="302" data-line-end="303">Ok so this is the serious stuff. We aren’t a hardcore raiding guild, but we do want to progress and we definitely dont want to spend hours wiping on bosses because guild members haven’t learnt the basics. So if you want to raid with us we hope that you’ll find it an enjoyable experience but there are a few minimum things that we ask everyone to do, please read on.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=304 data-line-end=305><a target='_blank' id="General_Information_304"></a>General Information</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="306" data-line-end="307">The following raids are currently available to max level (120) players:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="308" data-line-end="309">Uldir</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="309" data-line-end="310">Battle for Dazar’alor</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="310" data-line-end="311">Crucible of Storms</li>

</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="314" data-line-end="315">Of these raids only Ny’alotha is currently being actively progressed by the guild.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="316" data-line-end="317">All guild raid events are created in the in-game calendar so that guild members can sign-up <em>IF</em> they meet the requirements and are interested in joining. Please do use this facilty if at all possible as it helps us plan in advance, however we will also normally ask in guild chat and discord just before the raid start too.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="318" data-line-end="319">All raid times in the calendar and elsewhere are in realm time (CET)! Be aware of this if you are in the UK or other timezones please!</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="320" data-line-end="321">Usually we ask new raiders to go on a normal difficulty raid with us first, irrespective of gear item level, so that we can see their performance and knowledge of the raid before inviting them to a heroic difficulty raid. This is simply because in the past we’ve had a lot of players turn up in “heroic level” raid gear who simply have no idea what they’re doing (sadly raid boosts are easily bought now), and we dont want to waste a lot of time with needless wipes on heroic difficulty because some members are “punching above their weight”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="322" data-line-end="323">If you are in our “core” (i.e. heroic progression) raid team we do ask that you attend all heroic Ny’alotha raid events where possible, if you can’t make an event please try to let us know beforehand. Normal Ny’alotha and other raid events are optional for all guild members.</p>

These runs are much more casual and are usually aimed at obtaining mounts, transmog gear or achievements from past expansions. Attendance to these is completely optional, just make sure you are of the right character experience level to be able to enter the raid before signing up. These raid events in the calendar have names that normally start with “Glory of the…” to make it a bit easier to identify them.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="354" data-line-end="355">Other guild activites are arranged on a more ad-hoc basis and often just informally by discussion in guild chat. Please respect your fellow guildmates when asking for players to join in on various events as constant harrasment of players to join a dungeon, battleground or other group will just annoy people and lead to an unhealthy guild environment.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=356 data-line-end=357><a target='_blank' id="Mythic_Mythic__Dungeon_Runs_356"></a>Mythic/ Mythic + Dungeon Runs</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="358" data-line-end="359">For those who like to run the Mythic+ dungeons we do have a community of players doing this and it normally isn’t too difficult to get a group together through guild chat. Historically the guild has also organised Mythic+ spam events in the calendar, although this hasn’t happened as much of late due to the prevailing real world issues with the virus and many key guild members being at work in front-line jobs.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="360" data-line-end="361">Please also be aware that the guild does currently have a very heavy bias towards damage dealer roles, with healers and tanks being in short supply. This can be frustrating but is unlikely to improve unless guild members start playing the rarer roles.</p>
